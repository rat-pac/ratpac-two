/** GLG4HitPMTCollection stores GLG4HitPMT objects.

    The general contract for GLG4HitPMTCollection is as follows:
      - efficiently keep a bunch of GLG4HitPMTs with GLG4HitPhotons
      - provide Clear, DetectPhoton, SortTimeAscending, GetEntries, GetPMT,
        and Print(ostream &) functions
      - note the GLG4HitPhotons passed to DetectPhoton will become the
        "owned" by the GLG4HitPMTCollection and its GLG4HitPMTs, and they
        will take care of deletion.

    This is almost the same "general contract" that was implemented
    for KLG4sim's KLHitPMTCollection by O. Tajima and G. Horton-Smith,
    but the code was rewritten for GLG4sim in December 2004.
