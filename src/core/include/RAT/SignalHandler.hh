/** @class SignalHandler
 *  Catches UNIX signals sent to the main application by the operating system.
 *
 *  @author Stan Seibert <volsung@physics.utexas.edu>
 *
 *  This is a singleton which handles UNIX signals sent by the
 *  operating system.  It must be initialized in the main() function
 *  of the program by calling SignalHandler::Init().  Then SIGINT
 *  (sent by Ctrl-C) will be trapped by this handler.  All other
 *  signals remain connected to the default handlers.
 *
 *  When SIGINT is first received, a flag is set and execution resumes
 *  as normal.  The flag can be checked by calling
 *  SignalHandler::IsTermRequested().  If it returns true, then the
 *  current operation should be aborted as soon as it is possible
 *  without losing data.  In general, the only objects which need to
 *  check this flag are subclasses of Producer.  If the user really
 *  needs to abort now, they can hit Ctrl-C again, and the second time
 *  SIGINT is received, the application terminates immediately with no cleanup.
 *
 *  Note that this class only contains static methods and cannot be
 * instantiated.
