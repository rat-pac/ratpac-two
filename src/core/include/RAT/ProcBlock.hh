/** @class ProcBlock
 *  A logical group of processors to be executed sequentially.
 *
 *  @author Stan Seibert <volsung@physics.utexas.edu>
 *
 *  A processor block is analagous to a C++ block of statements.  It
 *  consists of a list of processors which it runs sequentially when
 *  DSEvent() is called.  The result code returned by a block when
 *  processing an event is roughly the logical AND of the result codes
 *  from the processors it contains.  See DSEvent() for more details.
 *
 *  New processors are added by calling AddProcessor() and the list is
 *  emptied when Clear() is called.  Note that when a processor is
 *  added to a ProcBlock, the block takes ownership of the
 *  processor object and will delete it when the list is clear or the
 *  block is deleted.
