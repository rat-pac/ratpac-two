/**
 * @class DS::RunStore
 * Run-level data structure helper class
 *
 * @author Stan Seibert <sseibert@lanl.gov>
 *
 * The RunStore coordinates the movement of run-level information
 * throughout the program.  Unless you have a really good reason,
 * you should always access the RunStore through the static methods,
 * and not create an instance of it yourself.
 *
 * This code handles DS::Run objects, which should be used to store
 * all run-level information that you wish to carry with the output
 * file.  In ROOT files, DS::Run objects are stored in a tree named
 * "runT" which has a single branch called "run" of type DS::Run.
 *
 * The current behavior of the RunStore is to cache all run records
 * in memory on demand, with no bound on memory usage of the cache.
 * Records are never flushed from the cache, and are written to the
 * output tree at the last possible moment.  This behavior may be
 * fine-tuned in the future.
 *
 * The rules for using the RunStore depend on who you are:
 *
 *   Generic Processor
 *   -----------------
 *
 *   Given an event, you can obtain the run information for that
 *   event by calling RunStore::GetRun() with a pointer to the event
 *   (DS::Root).  If the information cannot be found in the cache, or
 *   in a TTree registered to handle this information, a null pointer
 *   is returned.
 *
 *
 *   Output Processor
 *   ----------------
 *
 *   When opening an output ROOT file, the output processor must
 *   create a run tree.  The tree is registered by calling
 *   SetWriteTree().  Before closing the file containing the TTree,
 *   the output processor needs to call FlushWriteTree() to ensure
 *   all cached runs are written to the tree.
 *
 *
 *   Event Producer
 *   --------------
 *
 *   A producer of events (Gsim/inroot/etc) needs to either register
 *   an input TTree of run information using SetReadTree(), or needs
 *   to populate the cache with run records using AddNewRun().  The
 *   former is used by inroot, and the latter is used by Gsim.  In
 *   special circumstances, you might want to populate the cache from
 *   a tree (but not leave it permanently assocated), in which case
 *   you should use PreloadFromTree().
