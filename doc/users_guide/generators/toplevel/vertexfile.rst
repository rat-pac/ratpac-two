vertexfile
''''''''''
The VertexFile generator is used to take event vertices generated by RAT or any
other program (for example GENIE), and simulate them in RAT. Unlike the InROOT
event producer which only runs RAT processors on fully simulated events, this
generator starts from just the MCParticle and MCParent information and runs the
full Geant4 simulation as well.

The syntax is ::

    /generator/add vertexfile filename[:POSITION][:TIME][:NEVENTS][:NOFFSET]

where filename points to any RAT root file that at least has MC particle
information. POSITION and TIME arguments can be used to override the position
and time of vertices in the file by giving any position or time generator
listed below instead. If they are set to 'default', the positions / times given
in the root file will be used. It will simulate NEVENTS of the events in the
file, starting with event NOFFSET. If NEVENTS is less than the total number of
events to simulate set by /run/beamOn, the simulation will exit after NEVENTs.
