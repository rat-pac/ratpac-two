external
''''''''
This top-level generator creates one or more particles with type, momentum, and
optional time offset, spatial offset, and polarization, based on lines read
from a text file.  Synax::

    /generator/add external VERTEX:TIME:INPUT

VERTEX is either 'external' or a vertex generator.  If 'external' is specified,
vertex positions in INPUT are used.

TIME is a time generator.

INPUT is either a file or a program which outputs text in the format described
below(*).  INPUT should be surrounded by quotes.

Examples::

    /generator/add external external:poisson:"muons.dat"

Generates events listed in muons.dat using vertex locations specified in that
file and times generated by the poisson time generator.

::

    /generator/add external point:poisson:"/some/path/generateMuons 10 |"
    /generator/pos/set 0 0 0

Calls the program /some/path/generateMuons and generates the events output by
this program with position 0 0 0.

The format of the text input is::

    ISTHEP   == status code
    IDHEP    == HEP PDG code
    JDAHEP   == first daughter
    JDAHEP   == last daughter
    PHEP1    == px in GeV
    PHEP2    == py in GeV
    PHEP3    == pz in GeV
    PHEP5    == mass in GeV
    DT       == vertex _delta_ time, in ns (**)
    X        == x vertex in mm
    Y        == y vertex in mm 
    Z        == z vertex in mm 
    PLX      == x polarization
    PLY      == y polarization
    PLZ      == z polarization

PHEP5, DT, X, Y, Z, PLX, PLY, and PLZ are all optional. If omitted, the
respective quantity is left unchanged.  If DT is specified, the time offset of
this and subsequent vertices is increased by DT: (**) note DT is a relative
shift from the previous line.  (This is because there is often a very large
dynamic range of time offsets in certain types of events, e.g., in radioactive
decay chains, and this convention allows such events to be represented using a
reasonable number of significant digits.)  If X, Y, Z, PLX, PLY, and/or PLZ is
specified, then the values replace any previously specified.
