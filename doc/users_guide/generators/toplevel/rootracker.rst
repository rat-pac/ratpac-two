rootracker
''''''''''
The RooTracker generator is used to take event vertices generated by GENIE
and simulate them in RAT. GENIE GHEP files should be converted using the
``gntpc -f rootracker`` tool. This generator can read in primary vertex
information from any ROOT tree conforming to the GENIE RooTracker format,
and use this to populate the MC primary and MC parent information. The
functionality (and code) is similar to the VertexFile generator, which reads
the same information from RAT ROOT trees.

The syntax is ::

    /generator/add rootracker FILE_PATH[:POSITION][:TIME][:NEVENTS][:NOFFSET]

where ``FILE_PATH`` is the path to the RooTracker ROOT file. The ``POSITION``
and ``TIME`` arguments optionally specify a position and time generator, which
should be configured after this top-level generator. If these generators are
not specified, the position and time information from the input file is used.
The generator overrides are available to, e.g., simulate GENIE interactions
without a geometry (which will all be located at the origin) and distribute
them throughout a specified volume in the RAT geometry.
If ``NEVENTS`` or ``NOFFSET`` are specified, this sets the maximum event index
and starting point in file. Use ``/run/beamOn`` to set the number of events to
process; if ``NEVENTS`` is less, the event loop will terminate when this
limit is reached.
