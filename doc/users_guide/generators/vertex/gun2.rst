Modification of gun, the single particle gun.  Creates a particle identified by
pname (as above) with initial momentum (px, py, pz) given in arbitrary units
for pointing. 
The angle parameter sets the opening angle of a 'cone of fire'  such that angle
= 90 fires particles evenly into the hemisphere along the [px,py,pz] direction.
Setting angle to 0 gives the same behavior as gun.  

E1 and E2 determine the range of particle kinetic energies in MeV.  Setting E1
and E2 the same results in the same behavior as gun.  If E2 != E1 the particle
energy is randomly drawn from a flat distribution between E1 and E2. 

The optional polarization vector of the particle is given by (polx, poly,
polz).

If px=py=pz=0, then the gun generates particles with isotropic initial
directions.  Similarly, if polx=poly=polz=0, or the polarization vector is left
out, the particles will be randomly polarized.
