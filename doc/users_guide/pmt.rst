PMT Simulation
--------------
(Need to update this section, it is mostly out of date)

RAT uses a custom PMT simulation extracted from GLG4Sim.

Q/T Response
````````````
Gsim checks the database for single photoelectron charge and transit time PDFs
automatically for PMT models that are added to the geometry. These PDFs are
stored in tables named ``PMTCHARGE`` and ``PMTTRANSIT`` respectively, where the
index corresponds to a ``pmt_model`` field used in ``GEO`` tables. These PDFs
are sampled whenever a photon is absorbed by the photocathode to create a
realistic Q/T response automatically for PMTs independent of any DAQ processor.
If no tables are defined for a ``pmt_model`` the time defaults to approximately
zero spread from photoelectron absorption time and the charge defaults to a
phenomenological model used by MiniCLEAN.

``PMTCHARGE`` fields:
 * ``charge`` - "x" values of the charge PDF (arbitrary units)
 * ``charge_prob`` - "y" values of the charge PDF (will be normalized)
 
 
``PMTTRANSIT`` fields:
 * ``cable_delay`` - constant offset applied to all PMTs of this model (nanoseconds)
 * ``time`` - "x" values of the time PDF (nanoseconds)
 * ``time_prob`` - "y" values of the time PDF (will be normalized)

Dark Current
````````````

PMTs have an intrinsic noise rate, or "dark current", which results from
thermal excitation at the single electron level.  These thermal electrons can
exactly mimic a photoelectron from the PMT's photocathode and, thus, noise hits
cannot be distinguished from 'true' hits caused by incident photons.

On the upside, this makes the noise hits fairly simple to simulate: we can draw
from the same charge spectrum as is used for regular PMT hits.  The only
subtleties are in the timing distribution of the hits, and the rates at which
noise is generated.  This document describes the inclusion of noise hits in
RAT.

There old noise processor (source:rat/src/daq/NoiseProc.cc) had several
problems with the implementation, in particular the hits were incorrectly
distributed in time (generated for one sampling window width from the start of
the simulated event, therefore not extending throughout the event window), and
noise was defined in terms of a number of hits per event instead of a rate
(which is what we are more likely to measure).  In addition, under the
principle of "apathy should lead to the most realistic simulation possible" (-
Dr Stanley Seibert), it was decided to incorporate noise hits into the default
event simulation, rather than retaining the optional processor.  This avoids
the possibility of noise not being included either through forgetfulness, or
because the noise processor was run in the wrong order, for example after the
DAQ processors.  As a result, running RAT will now include PMT noise hits by
default, unless they are switched off.  Details on how to do so follow.

Control
'''''''
There are three options for the inclusion of noise, as follows:

0: No noise hits simulated.
1: Average noise rate read from 'noise_rate' in DAQ.ratdb.
2: Tube-by-tube noise rates read from 'PMTnoise' in DAQ.ratdb.

These options are controlled by the use of the 'noise_flag', in the DAQ.ratdb
file.  This flag can be include' in RAT macros as follows::

    /rat/db/set DAQ noise_flag x

where x = 0, 1, or 2, depending on the noise model chosen.

The noise is included in the simulation after the physics event has been
propagated (all particles followed to extinction, and PMT hits recorded) but
before the DAQ, which runs as a separate processor. All noise hits are flagged
with the 'isNoise' bit in the MCPhoton class (set to 1 for noise hits, and 0
for regular PMT hits).

Timing Distribution
'''''''''''''''''''
Noise hits are generated uniformly in time, throughout a pre-defined 'noise
window'.  The DAQ records data beginning from a predefined time before a
trigger.  This time period (pretrigger time) is given by a fixed number
(currently 1350) of sampling windows (4ns each).  We want noise to be simulated
throughout any recorded waveform.  The noise window therefore begins at a time
before the first photon hit given by this pretrigger time.  To allow for a
noise hit in coincidence with the last recorded photon to cause a trigger, the
noise window continues until the width of the event window, plus the width of a
single discriminator pulse, past the last photon hit time.

Speed and file size Comparison
''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''
To determine the effect of including noise in the default simulation, I
generated 1000 isotropic 20keV electrons at the centre of the detector using
each noise model.  Both the average and the individual tube noise rates were
set to 2000Hz, to emphasise any impact of including noise hits (default is
500Hz).  The results, in terms of CPU usage (output file size), were as
follows:

Noise model 0: 2280.91 s (46M)
Noise model 1: 2285.77 s (48M)
Noise model 2: 2341.45 s (48M)

So including noise in the simulation increases the processing time by 0.2%, and
simulating noise tube-by-tube increases it by a further 2.4%.

The file size increased by ~5% when noise was included in the simulation.

Parameters
''''''''''
All are stored in DAQ.ratdb

noise_rate: 500.0d, // The mean noise rate across all PMTs, in Hz
PMTnoise: [], // an array with 92 entries: individual noise rates per PMT, in Hz
noise_flag: 0, // the flag to determine which noise model you use (default is to turn noise off completely)
