outroot
=======
The ``OutROOT`` processor writes events to disk in the ROOT format.  The events are stored in a TTree object called "T" and the branch holding the events is called "ds". The full RAT data structure is described in :ref:`ratds`.

Command:
::

    /rat/proc outroot

Parameters:
::

    /rat/procset file "filename"

* filename (required, string) Sets output filename.  File will be deleted if it already exists.

.. _outntuple:

outntuple
=========
The ``OutNtuple`` processor writes events to disk as a flat ``ROOT`` Tree, and are thus much smaller and easier to work with than the files output by the outroot processor. There is also significant flexibility in what information is stored to the file, as detailed below. To run this processor and write the ntuple files out:

Command:
::

    /rat/proc outntuple

Parameters:
::

    /rat/procset file "filename"

    /rat/procset include_mcparticles 1
    /rat/procset include_tracking 1
    /rat/procset include_pmthits 1
    /rat/procset include_nestedtubehits 1
    /rat/procset include_untriggered_events 1
    /rat/procset include_mchits 1
    /rat/procset include_digitizerwaveforms 1
    /rat/procset include_digitizerhits 1
    /rat/procset include_digitizerfits 1

* filename (required, string) Sets output filename.  File will be deleted if it already exists.
* include_* (optional, int) Sets whether the ntuple structure will be extended to include more variables, as detailed below. By default the following, based on the entries in IO.ratdb, the following are set to 0 by default: ``include_tracking``, ``include_mcparticles``, and ``include_digitizerwaveforms`` and the rest are set to 1 by default (i.e., the associated variables aare included in the ntuple file, as detailed below).

Similarly to the outroot file, one can pass the filename using the "-o" flag by running the macro as::

    rat example_macro.mac -o output.root

The ntuple contains flat ``TTrees`` called ``meta`` and ``output``, and optionally a tree called ``waveform``. The ``output`` branch contains data for each event, and is structured to hold both the "true" simulated quantities as well as the "detector" quantities, that are filled after a data acquisition processor are run. As an example, we see in the below table that the ``output`` branch contains entries for ``mcx``, the true position of the simulated event, as well as ``triggerTime``, the time of the event trigger. This can lead to confusion because not all simulated events will trigger the detector. Importantly, if we do not run any DAQ simulation, none of the events will be saved unless ``include_untriggered_events`` is set to true. If you're entirely interested in studying variables generated prior to the data aquisition (e.g., particle position, number of Cherenkov photons produced, the true number of detected photoelectrons, etc.), be certain to set ``include_untriggered_events`` to true in the macro. 

If we do run the DAQ simulation, only information for the triggered events will be saved to the ``output`` branch, unless ``include_untriggered_events`` is set to true, in which case all events will be saved to the ``output`` branch. Furthermore, for triggered event we should expect to have differences between the simulated and detector quantities. For example, the ``mcPMTID`` (only filled when ``mchits`` is set true), the true set of PMTs that detected light, the ``hitPMTID`` (only filled when ``pmthits`` is set true), the set of PMTs that detected light after applying the data aquisition simulation, and the ``digitPMTID``, the set of PMTs that detected light after applying the data aquisition and waveform analysis simulations, can all be different length vectors (the ``hitPMTID`` and ``digitPMTID`` will always be a subset of ``mcPMTID``).

The ``meta`` branch of the output file should only have a single entry and contains information relevant for all simulated events, such as the run-number, the run-time, the PMT positions, and the total number of simulated events. The data-structure for the "default" ``meta`` tree, that are always written to the file, are:

If ``include_digitizerwaveforms`` is set then we create a new branch in the ntuple called ``waveform`` that stores the full digitized waveforms. Note this will significantly increase the size of the files. The ``waveform`` branch will contain the following variables:

=============================  ===================  ===================
**Name**                       **Type**             **Description**
=============================  ===================  ===================
``evid``                       int                  The event ID, repeated in the ``output`` tree.
``waveform_pmtid``             vector<int>          The unique PMT ID associated with the waveform.
``inWindowPulseTimes``         vector<double>       The list of MCPE front-end times that fall inside the waveform window.
``inWindowPulseCharges``       vector<double>       The list of MCPE charges that fall inside the waveform window.
``waveform``                   vector<ushort>       The digitized waveform, per PMT.

.. _outnet:

OutNet
======
NOTE: This processor is not currently supported. The below documentation is outdated, but may provide some useful information.

The !OutNet processor transmits events over the network to a listening copy of
RAT which is running the [wiki:UserGuideInNet InNet] event producer.  Multiple
listener hostnames may be specified, and events will be distributed across them
with very simplistic load-balancing algorithm.

This allows an event loop to be split over multiple machines.  I'll leave it to
your imagination to think up a use for this...

Command:
::

    /rat/proc outnet


Parameters:
::

    /rat/procset host "hostname:port"

* hostname:port (required) Network hostname (or IP address) and port number of
  listening RAT process.  

=== Notes ===

The "load balancing" mentioned above distributes events by checking to see
which sockets are available for writing and picking the first one that can be
found.  The assumption is that busy nodes will have a backlog of events, so
their sockets will be full.  In principle, this means that a few slow nodes
won't hold up the rest of the group.

This processor and its [wiki:UserGuideInNet sibling event producer] have no
security whatsoever.  Don't use your credit card number as a seed for the Monte
Carlo.
