Genie2Rat
`````````
Genie2Rat allows vertices generated with GENIE (www.genie-mc.org) to be
processed with RAT. It converts the root output of GENIE's gevgen_atmo
atmospheric neutrino simulation tool and converts it into RAT root format. Note
that gevgen_atmo requires a ROOT geometry for your detector to create vertices
in it. Once the GENIE file is created, this tool is then run using the syntax
::

  genie2rat -i [input genie filename] -o [output root filename] (-N [number of events to process])

and will output a RAT root file.
