Event Producers vs. Event Processors
------------------------------------

Ratpac distinguishes "producers" from "processors" during computation.  An event
producer is an object which creates new events in memory, either out of nowhere
(as in the Gsim Monte Carlo producer) or from some other external source like a
ROOT file.  The producer is responsible for allocating the memory, controlling
the loop over events, and calling the event loop for each event it creates.

An event processor is part of the event loop.  It does not create new events,
but instead receives events one-by-one and may either change the event by
adding to or altering its contents, or it may simply passively observe the
event.

The only reason you need to worry about this is because they way you interact
with these two entities in your macro file is very different.  Producers are
''executed immediately,'' whereas processors are ''declared.''  When the macro
file reader gets to a line like::

    /rat/proc count

it creates a new instance of the Count processor in memory and adds it to the
end of the global event loop, but nothing else happens.  No computation has
occurred, and no events are generated.

However, when you get to a line that invokes a producer, such as this one which
starts Gsim::

    /run/beamOn 100

Ratpac immediate begins to simulate 100 events, and each one is passed to the
event loop that has been declared thus far.  Execution of your macro file will
not continue until those 100 events have been generated and processed.

This is why, you must first create your processors before calling the event
producer, which procedurally looks backwards::

    # Event loop
    /rat/proc count
    /rat/procset update 5
    /rat/proc fitcentroid
    /rat/proc outroot
    /rat/procset file "fit.root"
    
    /generator/rates 3 1
    /generator/gun gamma 0 0 0  0 0 0  1.022
    /run/beamOn 10

You can also call several event producers sequentially in the same macro file
if you like.  For example, you could generate events at three energies this
way::

    /generator/rates 3 1
    /generator/gun gamma 0 0 0  0 0 0  1.022
    /run/beamOn 10
    /generator/gun gamma 0 0 0  0 0 0  2.461
    /run/beamOn 10
    /generator/gun gamma 0 0 0  0 0 0  8.600
    /run/beamOn 10

or even mix different event generators, though that probably isn't very useful.
