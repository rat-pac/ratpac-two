simpledaq
`````````
The SimpleDAQ processor simulates a minimal data acquisition system.  The time
of each PMT hit is the time of the first photon hit plus the timing
distribution of the appropriate PMT, and the charge collected at each PMT is
just the sum of all charge deposited at the anode, regardless of time.  All PMT
hits are packed into a single event.

Command
'''''''
::

    /rat/proc simpledaq

Parameters
''''''''''
None.

count
`````
The count processor exists mostly as a simple demonstration processor.  It also
displays messages periodically showing both how many physics events and
detector events have been processed. The message looks something like::

    CountProc: Event 5 (8 triggered events)


Command
'''''''
::

    /rat/proc count

Parameters
''''''''''
::

    /rat/procset update [interval]

* interval (optional, integer) - Sets number of physics events between between
  status update messages.  Defaults to 1 (print a message for every event).

prune
`````
The Prune processor is not a kitchen aid, but rather a processor for removing
unwanted parts of the data structure to save space.  The prune processor is
very useful to call before the [wiki:UserGuideOutRoot OutROOT] processor to
avoid writing large amounts of data to disk.

Note that there is minimal benefit to pruning in order to save memory in the
running program.  Only one data structure is present in memory at any given
time, and it is never copied.  Only when lots of events are written to disk
does the overhead become considerable.

Command
'''''''
::

    /rat/proc prune


Parameters
''''''''''
::

    /rat/procset prune "cutlist"

* cutlist - (required) a comma separated (no spaces) list of parts of the data
  structure to remove. [[BR]]The currently allowed entries are:

  * mc.particle
  * mc.pmt
  * mc.pmt.photon
  * mc.track
  * ev
  * ev.pmt

If /tracking/storeTrajectory is turned on, mc.track:particle is used, where
particle is the name of the particle track you want to prune
(mc.track:opticalphoton will prune optical photon tracks).

A complex example of pruning can be seen in the
[source:RAT/trunk/mac/prune.mac#latest prune.mac] macro file included in the
RAT source.

fitcentroid
```````````
The !FitCentroid processor reconstructs the position of detector events using
the charge-weighted sum of the hit PMT position vectors.

Command
'''''''
::

    /rat/proc fitcentroid

Parameters
''''''''''
None

Position fit information in data structure
''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''
* name - "centroid"
* figures of merit - None

fitpath
```````
The ``fitpath`` processor is an implementation (still a work in progress) of
the successful PathFitter algorithm used in SNO. It fits position, time, and
direction for cherenkov events using a maximum likelihood fit of hit time
residuals while taking into account different paths the hit could have taken.
For "direct" light (i.e. neither reflected nor scattered) an angular
distribution of cherenkov light is taken into account to fit the direction. All
other light is considered "other" and does not contribute to the direction fit.

Minimization is done in three stages:
1. Hit time residuals are minimized directly using `simulated-annealing`
from a static seed. 
2. PathFitter likelihood is minimized with `simulated-annealing` from
stage 1's result.
2) PathFitter likelihood is minimized with Minuit2 from stage 1's result.

Command
'''''''
::

    /rat/proc fitpath

Parameters
''''''''''
None required from macro. ``fitpath`` reads parameters from a table ``FTP``
containing the following fields:

outroot
```````
The OutROOT processor writes events to disk in the ROOT format.  The events are
stored in a TTree object called "T" and the branch holding the events (class
[source:RAT/trunk/include/RAT_DS.hh#latest RAT_DS]) is called "ds".

Command
'''''''
::

    /rat/proc outroot

Parameters
''''''''''
::

    /rat/procset file "filename"


* filename (required, string) Sets output filename.  File will be deleted if it already exists.

outnet
``````
The !OutNet processor transmits events over the network to a listening copy of
RAT which is running the [wiki:UserGuideInNet InNet] event producer.  Multiple
listener hostnames may be specified, and events will be distributed across them
with very simplistic load-balancing algorithm.

This allows an event loop to be split over multiple machines.  I'll leave it to
your imagination to think up a use for this...

Command
'''''''
::

    /rat/proc outnet


Parameters
''''''''''
::

    /rat/procset host "hostname:port"

* hostname:port (required) Network hostname (or IP address) and port number of
  listening RAT process.  

=== Notes ===

The "load balancing" mentioned above distributes events by checking to see
which sockets are available for writing and picking the first one that can be
found.  The assumption is that busy nodes will have a backlog of events, so
their sockets will be full.  In principle, this means that a few slow nodes
won't hold up the rest of the group.

This processor and its [wiki:UserGuideInNet sibling event producer] have no
security whatsoever.  Don't use your credit card number as a seed for the Monte
Carlo.
