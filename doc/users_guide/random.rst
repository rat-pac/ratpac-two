Random Numbers
--------------

All of Ratpac uses random numbers generated by the !HepJamesRandom class from
CLHEP.  This class implements the random number algorithm from ''F.James, Comp.
Phys. Comm. 60 (1990) 329'', which was also used in the FORTRAN library
MATHLIB.

Normally, the random number generator is initialized at startup using a seed
which is a mixture of the current time and the process ID of Ratpac.  With this
seeding scheme, two Ratpac instances should generate different event sequences,
even if they are started at the same time on the same machine or different
machines.  This assurance is probabilistic however, and not an absolute
guarantee.

The seed is always written to the log file:

.. code-block:: none

    This is Ratpac, version 1.0
    Status messages enabled: info detail 
    Seeding random number generator: 937308832


If desired, the seed can be selected at the command line using the -s switch.
For example, a seed of zero can be forced using::

    rat -s0 mac/std_test.mac

This is useful when debugging to reproduce an error caused by a particular
event sequence.  Any long integer may be used as the seed.
