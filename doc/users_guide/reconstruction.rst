Direction Center Fitter

The ``fitdirectioncenter`` processor reconstructs the direction of events
as the average of the vectors from the event position to the hit PMT positions.

Command:
::

    /rat/proc fitdirectioncenter

Parameters
''''''''''
No parameters are required though a position reconstruction would need to be run before.
Several useful parameters can be set in macro, which allows the processor to be run
multiple times with different settings in a single macro.

Detailed implementations are illustrated in macros/examples/fitdirectioncenter.mac
In particular, there is an example to correct for the drive effect in reconstructed
position.  First, a position reconstruction is run, then a direction reconstruction,
as usual.  However, a second direction reconstruction is run and takes both the
reconstructed position and direction as input to correct for the drive.  The resulting
position is then saved in the fitdirectioncenter FitResult.

Path Fitter
===========
The ``fitpath`` processor is an implementation (still a work in progress) of
the successful PathFitter algorithm used in SNO. It fits position, time, and
direction for cherenkov events using a maximum likelihood fit of hit time
residuals while taking into account different paths the hit could have taken.
For "direct" light (i.e. neither reflected nor scattered) an angular
distribution of cherenkov light is taken into account to fit the direction. All
other light is considered "other" and does not contribute to the direction fit.

Minimization is done in three stages:
1. Hit time residuals are minimized directly using `simulated-annealing`
from a static seed. 
2. PathFitter likelihood is minimized with `simulated-annealing` from
stage 1's result.
3. PathFitter likelihood is minimized with Minuit2 from stage 1's result.

FitMimir
========

``MIMIR`` is a general purpose event reconstruction framework that is meant to
encapsulate a large number of minimization-based reconstruction strategies
using a modular appraoch. It is designed to be flexible and extensible,
allowing a fit to be described in components taht can be added both in RATPAC2
itself and in a downstram prirvate experiment.

Command
'''''''
::

    /rat/proc mimir

Concepts
''''''''

Comoponents
+++++++++++
The MIMIR framework consists of a number of **components** that can be put
together into a full reconstruction recipe. There are three types of
components: 

- **CostFunction**: A function that the fit aims to minimize. This is typically a likelihood function
  or a similar function that produces a numerical value that represents the goodness of the current fit. 
- **Optimizer**: An engine that can minimize a given cost function (e.g. minuit, minuit2, NLOPT). 
- **FitStrategy**: A recipe that controls what is done in a fit. A fit strategy typically instantiates 
  and utilizes the above components during a fit. It is worthy of note that FitStrategies 
  can also consists of other FitStrategies, making them flexible and extensible.


ParamSet
++++++++

All MIMIR components manipulates a parameter set (``ParamSet``). This is a
structure that consists of the 7 possible paramers that could be fitted for a
event: The position of the event (xyz), the time of the event (t), the
direction of the event (theta, phi), and the energy of the event (E). For each
of these fields, ``ParamSet`` keeps track of the current value (either for
seeding or in the middle of a fit) of the field, the left and right bounds of
the value, as well as the status of the field. By default, the fields are set
to have bounds that are effectively infinite: the positional and time
coordinates have bounds at ``std::numerical_limits``, the directional componets
have bounds at ``[0, pi]`` and ``[-pi, pi]``, and energy has bounds at ``[0,
std::numerical_limits]``. 

The fields can take on the following statuses: 

- **INACTIVE**: The field does not participate in the fit nor the cost function.
  It will be ignored completely. 
- **FIXED**: The field does not participate in the fit, but is relevant for 
  evaluating the cost function. It will be passed to the cost function but its 
  value will not be modified by the optimizer.
- **ACTIVE**: The field is currently being fitted, it will be passed to the cost
  function and its value will be modified by the optimizer.


Top-level Configuration
'''''''''''''''''''''''
All components of MIMIR are cinfigured via entries to the RATDB. All
MIMIR-related configuration blocks have the tablename prefix of ``MIMIR_``. At
the very top level, the processor instance needs to be pointed to a
configuration for a ``FitStrategy`` configuration block. This can be done in
the macro via ``procset`` comamands. For example, to instruct the fitter to use
the strategy ``FitStep`` with the configuration type
``PositionTime_PMTTypeTimeResidual``, one would use:

::

    /rat/procset strategy "FitStep[PositionTime_PMTTypeTimeResidual]"

If no such ``procset`` command is given, MIMIR will fall back to the strategy specified in the RATDB. The following RATDB block does the same thing as above:

::

    {
      "name": "FIT_MIMIR",
      "index": "",
      "strategy": "FitStep",
      "strategy_config": "PositionTime_PMTTypeTimeResidual",
    }


Writing a MIMIR component
''''''''''''''''''''''''''
MIMIR components are all templated classes that requires the override of
several functions. The components can be added in either RATPAC2 itsslef or a
downstream experiment.

All components require the following to be done:

- override ``bool configure(ratdblinkptr db_link)``: this function receives a
  ratdb configuration block and correctly instatiates the component.
- register the component with the mimir framework by calling the following
  preprocessor macro: ``mimir_register_type(componettype, classname,
  "humanreadableclassname")``, where ``componenttype`` is either
  ``fitstrategy``, ``cost``, or ``optimizer`` in the ``rat::mimir`` namespace. 

Each type of component has the following additional requirements:

- **Cost**: Override the following functions:

  - ``double operator()(const ParamSet& params)``: takes in a ParamSet and 
    returns the value of the cost function for that set of parameters.

- **Optimizer**: Override the following function:

  - ``void minimizeimpl(std::function<double(const paramset&)> cost, paramset&params)``: 
    given a callable function `cost`, modifies `params` such that
    `cost` is minimized. note that the internal templating of `optimizer`
    allows this minimization routine to be used for both minimization and
    maximization via ``optimizer::minimize`` and ``optimizer::maximize``.

- **FitStrategy**:

  - Override the following functions:

    - ``void Execute(ParamSet &params)``: takes in the ``params`` as a set of
      seeds and bounds, perform the fit, and writes ther eseult back to
      ``params``.
  - During initialization, the FitStrategy also should:
    - correctly identifies the optimizers and costs associates with the
    strategy, look up the correct configuration bloccks from RATDB, and
    instantiate the components.

The Component Factory
+++++++++++++++++++++

To instantiate a MIMIR component, one should utilize the MIMIR component
factory, which provides many convenience functions for creating components
based on their type and configuration. The factory can be used as follows:

::

  Factory<Cost>::GetInstance().make_and_configure(name, index);

Where the complating typename ``Cost`` can be replaced with ``Optimizer`` or
``FitStrategy`` to create the corresponding component. The ``name`` and
``index`` are the type name and configuration index for the component,
respectively. The factory will create a component with typename ``name`` and
use the RATDB entry of ``MIMIR_name[index]`` for configuration.
