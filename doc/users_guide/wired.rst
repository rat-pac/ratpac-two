Setting up GEANT4 with HEPREP visuals and viewing in Wired 3
------------------------------------------------------------

Background
``````````
Before you start, the people at KSU believe that JAS3 is the way to go for
visuals, so for full disclosure, here is the link to their JAS3 how-to:

One of the advantages of GEANT4 is that it allows for visualizations of the
simulation. There are two types of visualizations: live and play-back. The live
ways of visualizations included OPENGL. An example of a play-back style
visualization is HEPREP.

This brief article will cover using HEPREP. The advantages of using HEPREP
instead of a live solution is that you can play data back at the speed you want
to see it, and you can also save simulation runs. HEPREP also has a program
called wired associated with it which is responsible for viewing the HEPREP
file. Setting up wired

Setting up GEANT4
`````````````````
In your mac directory you should create a file called vis.mac. This file will
hold all of your visualization information. Here is an example::

    /glg4debug/glg4param omit_muon_processes  1.0
    /glg4debug/glg4param omit_hadronic_processes  1.0
    
    /run/initialize
    
    /process/activate Cerenkov
    
    /vis/open HepRepFile
    /vis/scene/create
    /vis/scene/add/volume
    /vis/sceneHandler/attach
    /vis/scene/add/trajectories
    /vis/scene/add/hits
    /tracking/storeTrajectory 1 # view every photon (~18000 of them)

Running wired
`````````````
After you run an event, you should have a file called G4DataX.heprep, where X
is a positive integer, in the directory in which you ran your program. This
file is probably very large. Wired reads in HEPREP files compressed, so you
should gzip the file::

    gzip G4DataX.heprep

Load of wired on the machine you want to view the data on and then load up the
.heprep.gz file by during the normal File->Open sequence. You should now be
viewing your data.
