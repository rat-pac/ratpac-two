The RAT Database (RATDB)
------------------------

RATDB is the database of constants that will be used by RAT for all adjustable
parameters.  "Parameters" in this sense includes many things, such as:
* physical properties of materials (density, optics, etc.)
* geometric configuration of parts of the detector (dimensions and locations
of the acrylic vessel, PMTs, ...)
* calibration constants
* lookup tables
* control parameters which specify how processing should be done

Note that RATDB is NOT intended to hold actual event information, just everything else.

Despite the suggestive name, RATDB is not really a proper Database, like MySQL
or Oracle.  Rather it is just a simple set of C++ classes used to read
parameters from various sources (more on that later) and make the data easily
available to other parts of the RAT application.

How is the data organized?
``````````````````````````
Data in RATDB is organized in a two-level space.  At the top level are
''tables'', which contain groups of ''fields''.  So, every item in the RATDB is
located by these two things.

Tables
''''''
Tables are identified by names written in all capital letters which follow the
C++ rules for identifiers.  Only letters, numbers, and the underscore are
allowed, and the name must start with a non-digit.  Tables also carry an index,
which also follows identifier rules (mix case allowed).  The convention when
writing out table names is to put the index in brackets right after the name,
with the exception that it may be left off if the index is "" (the empty
string).

Some examples of valid table names are::

  CALIB, DAQ_CHANNELS, THETA13, MEDIA[vacuum], MEDIA[water], MEDIA[acrylic]

The index is intended to allow several tables with the same fields to exist.
For example, you might standardize a MEDIA table that holds properties for all
the materials in the detector.  All materials will have the same set of
properties (density, index of refraction, etc), and each material will be given
a different index.  Many tables will not need this functionality, so you are
free to ignore the index when dealing with them, and the index will be
implicitly understood to be empty by RATDB.

Fields
''''''
Every table contains zero or more fields.  Similar to table names, field names
also follow the C++ identifier convention, but use only lowercase letters.
Each field has associated with it a piece of data of a distinct type.  The
currently allowed types are: integers, floats, doubles, strings, integer
arrays, float arrays, double arrays, and string arrays.

Arrays will only contain elements of the same type, and there must be at least
one element in an array.  The length of the array, however, is not specified
and is allowed to change.

Planes
''''''
Normally, tables and fields are all you have to think about, but RATDB also
addresses an additional complication: overriding constants.  It is a common use
case to have default values of constants, values which are only valid in
certain time intervals and can change (like the optical properties of the
scintillator), and user-specified values which are intended to override
everything.

RATDB handles this by internally grouping tables into three ''planes''.  The
name is intended to suggest a stack of layers where you start at the top, and
keep going down until you find your answer.  The RATDB planes are (from highest
to lowest priority):

 * the user plane
 * the time plane
 * the default plane

When an item is requested, RATDB will attempt to locate it in the user plane
first, then the time plane, and finally the default plane.  Note that this is
all handled in the background.  You simply request the index_of_refraction
field in the MEDIA[acrylic] table, and RATDB figures out the appropriate plane
from which to retrieve the data.

How do I load data into RATDB?
``````````````````````````````
RATDB has the potential to read data from a variety of sources (such as real
SQL databases), but right now only supports reading data in the RATDB text
format.  Read the [wiki:RATDB_TextFormat RATDB text format] page for
instructions on how to compose such a file.

Once you have your text file, you have two options for loading it:

* Give it the .ratdb extension and place it into the $GLG4DATA directory.  This
  is usually the same as $RATROOT/data.  All .ratdb files in that directory are
  automatically loaded when RAT first starts.
* Manually load the file in your macro using a command like::

    /rat/db/load myfile.ratdb


You can also set the value of individual fields in the database inside the your
macro using commands like::

    /rat/db/set MEDIA[acrylic] index_of_refraction 1.52
    /rat/db/set GEO_DETECTOR av_radius 6.2

The /rat/db/set command alters fields in the user plane, so they will override
any other values set on the time or default planes.

Note that these changes are not saved when you exit RAT.  If you want
permanently change the value of a field, you need to edit the relevant .ratdb
file in the data/ directory.  Also note that /rat/db/set will create new tables
in memory if they do not already exist.

Limitations
```````````
RATDB is not finished by any means, but is complete enough to address immediate
needs.  Current limitations include:

* Tables cannot be added to the time plane.  Properly implementing the time
  plane will be non-trivial and require implementing caching and load-on-demand
  semantics for tables.  At the moment, only the user and default planes exist,
  but adding the time plane will not require any changes to user code or
  macros.  We don't need it now, so there is no sense in investing the time to
  implement it yet.
